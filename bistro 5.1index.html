<h2>The Restaurant</h2>
<p>The Black Goose Bistro offers casual lunch and dinner fare in a relaxed
atmosphere. The menu changes regularly to highlight the freshest local
ingredients.</p>
<h2 style="background-color:powderblue;">Tapenade <em>(Olive Spread)</em></h2>
<p style="background-color:tomato;">This is a really simple dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at
parties. My father recommends: <q>"Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just
bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In the winter, try
serving it warm."</q></p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 8oz. jar sundried tomatoes</li>
<li>2 large garlic cloves</li>
<li>2/3 c. kalamata olives</li>
<li>1 t. capers</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Blend until as smooth as
possi-ble.
Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are
incorporated, but still retain some
texture.
Serve on thin toast rounds with goat cheese and fresh basil garnish
<strong style="<#value#>">(optional).</strong></p>
